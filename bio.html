                Furrylicious first rose to power by defeating the local menace, Mittens. The battle was costly, however, and her hold on the Wooden Fence throne was weak. Until all of Mittens' henchmen were banished, the safest move was remarking the territory's borders.
                <br/><br/>
                Her popular new policies earned her much support, and her allies grew steadily. Before long, it was time to hunt down the last of Mittens' crew.
                <br/><br/>
                Furrylicious unwaveringly lead every patrol, even during the flood of '07, and before the first snow, the last wretched mongrel had been chased out. The neighborhood was finally secure.
                <br/><br/>
                Under Furrylicious' compassionate paw, the kingdom enjoyed an unprecedented era of peace and diplomacy that spanned all the species. Even today, one can see Terriers and tabbies frolicking together as one people.
